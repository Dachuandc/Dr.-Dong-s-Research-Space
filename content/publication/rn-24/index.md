abstract: "PURPOSE: A disconnect often exists between those with the expertise to\
  \ manage and analyze complex, multi-source data sets, and the clinical, social services,\
  \ advocacy, and public health professionals who can pose the most relevant questions\
  \ and best apply the answers. We describe development and implementation of a cancer\
  \ informatics infrastructure aimed at broadening the usability of community cancer\
  \ data to inform cancer control research and practice; and we share lessons learned.\
  \ METHODS: We built a multi-level database known as The Ohio Cancer Assessment and\
  \ Surveillance Engine (OH-CASE) to link data from Ohio's cancer registry with community\
  \ data from the U.S. Census and other sources. Space-and place-based characteristics\
  \ were assigned to individuals according to residential address. Stakeholder input\
  \ informed development of an interface for generating queries based on geographic,\
  \ demographic, and disease inputs and for outputting results aggregated at the state,\
  \ county, municipality, or zip code levels. RESULTS: OH-CASE contains data on 791,786\
  \ cancer cases diagnosed from 1/1/2006 to 12/31/2018 across 88 Ohio counties containing\
  \ 1215 municipalities and 1197 zip codes. Stakeholder feedback from cancer center\
  \ community outreach teams, advocacy organizations, public health, and researchers\
  \ suggests a broad range of uses of such multi-level data resources accessible via\
  \ a user interface. CONCLUSION: OH-CASE represents a prototype of a transportable\
  \ model for curating and synthesizing data to understand cancer burden across communities.\
  \ Beyond supporting collaborative research, this infrastructure can serve the clinical,\
  \ social services, public health, and advocacy communities by enabling targeting\
  \ of outreach, funding, and interventions to narrow cancer disparities."
