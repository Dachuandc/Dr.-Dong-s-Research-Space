abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Disparities in the stage at diagnosis for breast cancer have
  been independently associated with various contextual characteristics. Understanding
  which combinations of these characteristics indicate highest risk, and where they
  are located, is critical to targeting interventions and improving outcomes for patients
  with breast cancer. METHODS: The study included women diagnosed with invasive breast
  cancer between 2009 and 2018 from 680 U.S. counties participating in the Surveillance,
  Epidemiology, and End Results program. We used a machine learning approach called
  Classification and Regression Tree (CART) to identify county \"phenotypes,\" combinations
  of characteristics that predict the percentage of patients with breast cancer presenting
  with late-stage disease. We then mapped the phenotypes and compared their geographic
  distributions. These findings were further validated using an alternate machine
  learning approach called random forest. RESULTS: We discovered seven phenotypes
  of late-stage breast cancer. Common to most phenotypes associated with high risk
  of late-stage diagnosis were high uninsured rate, low mammography use, high area
  deprivation, rurality, and high poverty. Geographically, these phenotypes were most
  prevalent in southern and western states, while phenotypes associated with lower
  percentages of late-stage diagnosis were most prevalent in the northeastern states
  and select metropolitan areas. CONCLUSIONS: The use of machine learning methods
  of CART and random forest together with geographic methods offers a promising avenue
  for future disparities research. IMPACT: Local interventions to reduce late-stage
  breast cancer diagnosis, such as community education and outreach programs, can
  use machine learning and geographic modeling approaches to tailor strategies for
  early detection and resource allocation.'
