abstract: "BACKGROUND: The objective of this study is to understand the effect of\
  \ Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on patterns of surgical\
  \ care among low-income breast cancer patients. Emerging literature suggests cancer\
  \ patients in Medicaid expansion states are presenting with earlier stages of disease.\
  \ However, less is known regarding the implications of Medicaid expansion on patterns\
  \ of surgical care in low-income women. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared nonmetastatic\
  \ 30-64-year-old uninsured or Medicaid-insured Ohio breast cancer patients diagnosed\
  \ 4 years before and 4 years after the state's 2014 Medicaid expansion (study group);\
  \ the control group was the privately insured. Time-to-surgery (TTS) was defined\
  \ as days from diagnosis to surgery. Demographic and treatment variables before\
  \ and after expansion were examined in multivariate analysis. RESULTS: There was\
  \ a 10.4% point increase in breast conservation therapy (BCT) in the study group\
  \ (pre-ACA 26.3%, post-ACA 36.7%; p < 0.01) compared with a 5.8% point increase\
  \ in the control group (pre-ACA 36.0%, post-ACA 41.8%; p < 0.01). Disparities in\
  \ reconstruction narrowed between the study (pre-ACA 21.4%, post-ACA 34.5%; p <\
  \ 0.01) and the control (37.0% pre-ACA, 44.1% post-ACA group p < 0.01) groups. There\
  \ was no statistically significant change in mean TTS in the study group (pre-ACA\
  \ 42.1 days, post-ACA 43.1 days p = 0.18) but there was an increase in TTS in the\
  \ control group (pre-ACA 35.0 days, post ACA 37.0 days; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS:\
  \ Medicaid expansion appears to have narrowed disparities in the utilization of\
  \ BCT and reconstruction in low-income women. However, there was no improvement\
  \ in surgical delay."
