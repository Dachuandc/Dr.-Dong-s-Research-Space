abstract: 'Importance: The association between cancer mortality and risk factors may
  vary by geography. However, conventional methodological approaches rarely account
  for this variation. Objective: To identify geographic variations in the association
  between risk factors and cancer mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: This
  geospatial cross-sectional study used county-level data from the National Center
  for Health Statistics for individuals who died of cancer from 2008 to 2019. Risk
  factor data were obtained from County Health Rankings & Roadmaps, Health Resources
  and Services Administration, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Analyses
  were conducted from October 2021 to July 2022. Main Outcomes and Measures: Conventional
  random forest models were applied nationwide and by US region, and the geographical
  random forest model (accounting for local variation of association) was applied
  to assess associations between a wide range of risk factors and cancer mortality.
  Results: The study included 7179201 individuals (median age, 70-74 years; 3409508
  women [47.5%]) who died from cancer in 3108 contiguous US counties during 2008 to
  2019. The mean (SD) county-level cancer mortality rate was 177.0 (26.4) deaths per
  100000 people. On the basis of the variable importance measure, the random forest
  models identified multiple risk factors associated with cancer mortality, including
  smoking, receipt of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, and
  obesity. The geographical random forest model further identified risk factors that
  varied at the county level. For example, receipt of SNAP benefits was a high-importance
  factor in the Appalachian region, North and South Dakota, and Northern California;
  smoking was of high importance in Kentucky and Tennessee; and female-headed households
  were high-importance factors in North and South Dakota. Geographic areas with certain
  high-importance risk factors did not consistently have a corresponding high prevalence
  of the same risk factors. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study,
  the associations between cancer mortality and risk factors varied by geography in
  a way that did not correspond strictly to risk factor prevalence. The degree to
  which other place-specific characteristics, observed and unobserved, modify risk
  factor effects should be further explored, and this work suggests that risk factor
  importance may be a preferable paradigm for selecting cancer control interventions
  compared with risk factor prevalence.'
