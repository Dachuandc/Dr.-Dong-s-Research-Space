abstract: "OBJECTIVE: To assess a new approach (weighting by \\\"income probabilities\
  \ [IP]\\\") that uses US Census data from the patients' communities to approximate\
  \ individual-level income, an important but often missing variable in health services\
  \ research. DATA SOURCES: Community (census tract level) income data came from the\
  \ 2017 5-year American Community Survey (ACS). The patient data included those diagnosed\
  \ with cancer in 2017 in Ohio (n = 65,759). The reference population was the 2017\
  \ 5-year ACS Public Use Microdata Sample (n = 564,357 generalizing to 11,288,350\
  \ Ohioans). STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: We applied the traditional approach of income\
  \ approximation using median census tract income along with two IP based approaches\
  \ to estimate the proportions in the patient data with incomes of 0%-149%, 150%-299%,\
  \ 300%-499%, and 500%+ of the federal poverty level (FPL) (\\\"class-relevant income\
  \ grouping\\\") or 0%-138%, 139%-249%, 250%-399%, and 400%+ FPL (\\\"policy-relevant\
  \ income grouping\\\"). These estimated income distributions were then compared\
  \ with the known income distributions of the reference population. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION\
  \ METHODS: The patient data came from Ohio's cancer registry. The other data were\
  \ publicly available. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Both IP based approaches consistently\
  \ outperformed the traditional approach overall and in subgroup analyses, as measured\
  \ by the weighted average absolute percentage point differences between the proportions\
  \ of each of the income categories of the reference population and the estimated\
  \ proportions generated by the income approximation approaches (\\\"average percent\
  \ difference,\\\" or APD). The smallest APD for an IP based method, 0.5%, was seen\
  \ in non-Hispanic White females in the class-relevant income grouping (compared\
  \ with 16.5% for the conventional method), while the largest APD, 7.1%, was seen\
  \ in non-Hispanic Black females in the policy-relevant income grouping (compared\
  \ with 18.0% for the conventional method). CONCLUSIONS: Weighting by IP substantially\
  \ outperformed the conventional approach of estimating the distribution of incomes\
  \ in patient data."
