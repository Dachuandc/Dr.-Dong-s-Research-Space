 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Black women diagnosed with breast cancer in the U.S. tend to experience significantly longer waits to begin treatment than do their white counterparts, and such treatment delay has been associated with poorer survival. We sought to identify the factors driving or mitigating treatment delay among Black women in an urban community where treatment delay is common. METHODS: Applying the SaTScan method to data from Ohio's state cancer registry, we identified the community within Cuyahoga County, Ohio (home to Cleveland) with the highest degree of breast cancer treatment delay from 2010 through 2015. We then recruited breast cancer survivors living in the target community, their family caregivers, and professionals serving breast cancer patients in this community. Participants completed semi-structured interviews focused on identifying barriers to and facilitators of timely breast cancer treatment initiation after diagnosis. RESULTS: Factors reported to impact timely treatment fell into three primary themes: informational, intrapersonal, and logistical. Informational barriers included erroneous beliefs and lack of information about processes of care; intrapersonal barriers centered on mistrust, fear, and denial; while logistical barriers involved transportation and financial access, as well as patients' own caregiving obligations. An informational facilitator was the provision of objective and understandable disease information, and a common intrapersonal facilitator was faith. Logistical facilitators included financial counseling and mechanisms to assist with Medicaid enrollment. Crosscutting these themes, and mentioned frequently, was the centrality of both patient navigators and support networks (formal and, especially, informal) as critical lifelines for overcoming barriers and leveraging facilitating factors. CONCLUSIONS: The present study describes the numerous hurdles to timely breast cancer treatment faced by Black women in a high-risk urban community. These hurdles, as well as corresponding facilitators, can be classified as informational, intrapersonal, and logistical. Observing similar results on a larger scale could inform the design of interventions and policies to reduce race-based disparities in processes of cancer care.},
