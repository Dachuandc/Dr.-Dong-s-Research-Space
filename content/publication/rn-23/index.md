abstract: "BACKGROUND: Black women diagnosed with breast cancer in the U.S. tend to\
  \ experience significantly longer waits to begin treatment than do their white counterparts,\
  \ and such treatment delay has been associated with poorer survival. We sought to\
  \ identify the factors driving or mitigating treatment delay among Black women in\
  \ an urban community where treatment delay is common. METHODS: Applying the SaTScan\
  \ method to data from Ohio's state cancer registry, we identified the community\
  \ within Cuyahoga County, Ohio (home to Cleveland) with the highest degree of breast\
  \ cancer treatment delay from 2010 through 2015. We then recruited breast cancer\
  \ survivors living in the target community, their family caregivers, and professionals\
  \ serving breast cancer patients in this community. Participants completed semi-structured\
  \ interviews focused on identifying barriers to and facilitators of timely breast\
  \ cancer treatment initiation after diagnosis. RESULTS: Factors reported to impact\
  \ timely treatment fell into three primary themes: informational, intrapersonal,\
  \ and logistical. Informational barriers included erroneous beliefs and lack of\
  \ information about processes of care; intrapersonal barriers centered on mistrust,\
  \ fear, and denial; while logistical barriers involved transportation and financial\
  \ access, as well as patients' own caregiving obligations. An informational facilitator\
  \ was the provision of objective and understandable disease information, and a common\
  \ intrapersonal facilitator was faith. Logistical facilitators included financial\
  \ counseling and mechanisms to assist with Medicaid enrollment. Crosscutting these\
  \ themes, and mentioned frequently, was the centrality of both patient navigators\
  \ and support networks (formal and, especially, informal) as critical lifelines\
  \ for overcoming barriers and leveraging facilitating factors. CONCLUSIONS: The\
  \ present study describes the numerous hurdles to timely breast cancer treatment\
  \ faced by Black women in a high-risk urban community. These hurdles, as well as\
  \ corresponding facilitators, can be classified as informational, intrapersonal,\
  \ and logistical. Observing similar results on a larger scale could inform the design\
  \ of interventions and policies to reduce race-based disparities in processes of\
  \ cancer care."
