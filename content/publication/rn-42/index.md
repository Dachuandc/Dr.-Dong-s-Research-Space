abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To understand changes in reasons for visit to primary care in
  the face of an aging population, growing evidence for proactive preventive and chronic
  disease services, and the rise of the chronic care model. METHODS: We examined the
  reason for visits to primary care physicians using the National Ambulatory Medical
  Care Survey (NAMCS) from 1980-2015. RESULTS: Among all physicians, the percent of
  visits for prevention increased from 17% in 2001 to 20% in 2015. Among visits to
  primary care, most continued to be for acute problems - with the percent of visits
  for acute illness declining over the past 15 years, after remaining steady for two
  decades. Preventive care visits increased from 19% in 2001 to 26% in 2015. The percent
  of primary care visits for chronic conditions declined between 1980 and 2000, and
  then remained steady, accounting for 30% in 2001 and 31% in 2015. CONCLUSIONS: Growing
  emphasis on chronic disease management is not reflected in the percent of primary
  care visits for chronic illness. This study highlights the potential utility of
  longitudinal data within a historical interpretive frame, while raising questions
  about the utility of using a main reason for visit to classify complex primary care
  visits.'
