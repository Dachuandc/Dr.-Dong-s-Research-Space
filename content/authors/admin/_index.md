# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am a lifetime learner with a commitment to using geospatial approaches in understanding health disparities. My recent interest is in investigating geographic variations of cancer diagnosis (i.e., later-stage diagnosis and access to screening services) and treatments (i.e., delayed time to treatment initiation, breast cancer conserving therapy, and breast reconstruction surgery) to understand the cause of cancer disparities using statistical, geographic, and machine learning methods.
